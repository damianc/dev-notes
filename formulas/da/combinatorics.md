# Combinatorial Analysis

| Set | Formula |
|--|--|
| permutation | $$P_n = n!$$ |
| combination | $$C_n^k = (_k^n)$$ |
| variation without repetition | $$V_n^k = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$$ |
| variation with repetition | $$W_n^k = n^k$$ |

## Binomial coefficient

> read as _n choose k_

$$
(_k^n) = \frac{n!}{k! \cdot (n-k)!}
$$
